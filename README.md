![Zion Emond, Software Engineer](./github-header-banner.png)

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Zion Emond: a software engineer currently working for [CQL LLC](https://www.cqlcorp.com/) developing enterprise ecommerce solutions at scale. 

I specialize in creating web-based interfaces, both frontend and backend, mainly with JavaScript-based frameworks like React.js and Node.js.

Currently my favorite stack is:
* TypeScript
* React.js
* Node.js
* Next.js

But I've also touched:
* Express (or at least an Express derivative)
* GraphQL
* JQuery
* C#
* ASP.NET
* Python
* PostgreSQL
* AWS Lambdas/SDK

âš¡ Fun fact: I almost always sneeze at least three times. Don't bother saying 'bless you' until after the third sneeze, or you're certain that I'm finished sneezing.

<h1><span aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”­</span> Projects</h1>

My main goal with any project I do is to learn something new. I love constantly learning new things, it's what keeps me going.

I'm currently working on [NanoHabits](https://github.com/WarriorAchilles/NanoHabits) off and on. My goal here is to create a minimalist habit tracker app that uses AI to help users break down their goals into small, actionable, daily habits.
